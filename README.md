## Project

This project aims to ask the user a series of questions.  Update Google sheets with answers and to relay to the user their answers and how they compare with all other answers giving results of all the question.  My aim is to be able to add more questions to the survey without having to change python code.

## User

![First Screen](https://github.com/Bryan-Nolan/coder-survey/blob/main/assets/readme_images/first.screen.jpg)

During this the user will be asked a series of questions and give predefined answers to choose from.  After answering all questions, the user will be given a list of their choices, the total of participates to date with survey and the results in percentages of what the total of participates voted for.

## Features

On beginning the user is told how many questions they will be answering and that the results will be displayed at end.

There is also built-in error detection that if the user enters anything other than the required values they will be told of error and to ty again.

After answering all questions, the user receives a summary of all the questions asked and how other participants response shown as percentages.

### Future Features

In the future I would consider adding the following feature.
    * Users adding email addresses as to have 1 try per user
    * Adding a feature to have an admin user as to add questions through the program.

## Testing

This has been manually tested. Code has been passed through PEP8 and the only issues are lines of code exceeding 79 characters in length.  Unauthorised inputs have also been taken into account by prompting user to enter correct data. Also used GitIo terminal to show errors and Code Institute Heroku terminal.  

My Testers were my son Cormac (17) and daughter Heather (14). They provided great insight to navigating site and content.

### Validator Testing

#### Python

* PEP8
    [PEP8online.com](http://pep8online.com/)
    Two errors for long lines of code were shown but this does not affect running of program.

### Unfixed Bugs
