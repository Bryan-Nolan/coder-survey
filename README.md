## Project

This project aim to ask the user a seris of questions.  Update Gooogle sheets with answers and to relay to the user their answers and how they compare with the all others answers giving results of all the question.  My aim is to be able to add more questions to the survey without having to change python code.

## Responsive

![Responsive]()

In these times of multiple devices accessing websites, I have decided to make my site responsive to the following sizes

Screen Size below 1280 pixels which to me equates to Laptop Screen.
Screen Size below 768 pixels which to equates to tablet
Screen Size below 500 pixels to suit large phone.
Screen Size below 350 pixels to mobile.
