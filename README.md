## Project

This project aims to ask the user a series of questions.  Update Google sheets with answers and to relay to the user their answers and how they compare with all other answers giving results of all the question.  My aim is to be able to add more questions to the survey without having to change python code.

## User

![First Screen](https://github.com/Bryan-Nolan/coder-survey/blob/main/assets/readme_images/first.screen.jpg)

During this the user will be asked a series of questions and give predefined answers to choose from.  After answering all questions, the user will be given a list of their choices, the total of participates to date with survey and the results in percentages of what the total of participates voted for.
