## Responsive

![Responsive]()

In these times of multiple devices accessing websites, I have decided to make my site responsive to the following sizes

Screen Size below 1280 pixels which to me equates to Laptop Screen.
Screen Size below 768 pixels which to equates to tablet
Screen Size below 500 pixels to suit large phone.
Screen Size below 350 pixels to mobile.
